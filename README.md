# VSD-Sky130-OpenLANE-Workshop
Attended a 5-Day workshop on [Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/advanced-physical-design-using-openlane-sky130/) conducted by [VLSI System Design](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/). The workshop introduced us to opensource EDA tools and PDKs and how are they used in the semiconductor industry. We performed the synthesis, floorplan, placement, clock tree synthesis and routing in openlane tool. We also designed and characterized a library cell in ngspice.

# Prerequisites
Installed and ran OpenLANE on Ubuntu OS. It is recommended to allocate 4GB RAM and 40GB Disk Space to OS for smooth functioning. Windows user can use Oracle VM VirtualBox to run the OS. For further information about installation of OpenLANE and open-source EDA tools, refer to the following two videos on Udemy by VSD.
